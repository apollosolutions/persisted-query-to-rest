# Example

This small example starts up using the `latest` docker image. Feel free to edit the config locally and try for yourself.

* Run `./config-schema.sh` to generate a new config json file to help with YAML autocomplete
* Run `./start.sh` to quickly run the latest image with all the config files in the local folder
